# Agent Context — Read-only USB Mass Storage

<!-- GENERATED FILE — DO NOT EDIT. Source: README.md -->

- Package: `iobewi-usb-msc`
- Path: `drivers/usb/msc`
- Layer: `portable-service`
- Status: `implemented`

## Role

Allocation-free Embassy USB Mass Storage class over a portable 512-byte read-only
block device. Extracted from the functional USB Radio POC at `c118e0c` without
extending its intentionally limited BOT/SCSI implementation.

## Owns

- Register a full-speed bulk-only MSC interface (class 08, subclass 06, protocol 50).
- Handle the implemented SCSI command subset and return CBW-tagged CSWs.
- Obtain medium capacity and sectors through `iobewi-block`.
- Forward USB endpoint session boundaries to the block device.
- Apply caller-supplied unavailable-sector decisions; do not invent retry policy.

## Does not own

- No FAT layout, file name, stream buffering, URL, MP3 processing or radio policy.
- No platform HAL, GPIO selection, physical flash ownership or USB driver wrapper.
- No VID/PID, USB product strings, power declaration or prebuffer-before-exposure policy.
- No complete BOT/SCSI conformance claim, media writes or Workload binary ABI.

## Architecture position

Portable service at `drivers/usb/msc`. Embassy USB's `Driver` supplies hardware
operations; `fs/block` supplies medium data. Identity and unavailable-data policy
are supplied by the composition root. Source/API portability does not imply support
for every USB speed or host. Hardware qualification remains required.

## Public contracts

`State::new` provides caller-owned class control state. `MscClass::new` receives
an Embassy `Builder`, that state, and `InquiryIdentity` (8-byte vendor, 16-byte
product, 4-byte revision). No identity is baked into the service.

`MscClass::run(device, policy)` consumes `ReadOnlyBlockDevice` and `ReadPolicy`.
`ReadPolicy::unavailable(status, elapsed)` is called only for `Pending` or
`Expired`; it returns `RetryAfter(Duration)` or `ZeroFill`. Elapsed time starts
before the first read of each sector. `ZeroFill` sends the block contract's
zero-filled sector and preserves successful-command semantics. No default retry,
poll interval, timeout or stale-data policy is supplied.

`run` returns `Error::UnsupportedCapacity` before starting any session if the
inclusive last LBA is `u32::MAX`, since READ FORMAT CAPACITIES cannot represent
that medium's sector count. Other terminal failures return `Error::Endpoint`.
The capacity must remain stable for the device lifetime as required by `fs/block`.

## Invariants

- INV-001: no platform implementation dependency.
- INV-008: generic Embassy driver preserves source/API portability.

## Modification context

### Lifecycle

The caller runs the Embassy USB device future alongside `run`. After the OUT
endpoint becomes enabled, the class resets diagnostic counters and calls
`begin_session`. Endpoint disable calls `end_session` and waits for a subsequent
enable, allowing a streaming block device to rebase. Other endpoint errors also
call `end_session` before returning. A future cancelled externally does not run
an asynchronous cleanup or guarantee an `end_session` call.

During READ(10), sector reads are non-blocking. The class retries only as directed
by the policy, then sends sector bytes in 64-byte packets. If a policy chooses
unbounded retries, bus disable is observed only when endpoint I/O is next reached;
the class does not impose an independent timeout or cancellation check.

## Required validation

Run `cargo fmt -p iobewi-usb-msc --check`, `cargo check -p iobewi-usb-msc` and
`cargo test -p iobewi-usb-msc`. Host tests check golden packet fields and the
supported capacity boundary; fake-driver consumer dialogues exercise actual endpoint
traffic and session callbacks. BG-USB-MSC requires supported-target compilation
and physical USB-host evidence for complete qualification.

## Known limitations

- Fixed 512-byte sectors, two bulk endpoints with 64-byte maximum packets, one
  advertised LUN and read-only direct-access removable media.
- Implemented commands: TEST UNIT READY, INQUIRY, REQUEST SENSE, MODE SENSE(6),
  START STOP UNIT, PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL, READ FORMAT CAPACITIES,
  READ CAPACITY(10), READ(10). START STOP and PREVENT ALLOW are no-ops.
- CBW direction/flags are ignored. LUN 0..15 and command lengths 1..16 are accepted
  by the parser although only LUN zero is advertised and CDB lengths are not
  validated per opcode. Unsupported opcodes report illegal request/invalid opcode.
- Malformed CBWs and non-31-byte packets are ignored without endpoint stall or
  BOT recovery. BULK-ONLY RESET is acknowledged without worker/command-state reset.
- No BOT phase-error matrix, write commands, READ(12), allocation-length handling
  in SCSI CDBs, or terminating data-stage ZLP logic.
- READ(10) sends the requested sector count without bounding it by CBW transfer
  length. CSW residue uses saturating subtraction, preserving the reference.
- Out-of-range READ(10) fails with illegal request/LBA out of range. REQUEST SENSE
  consumes the stored error once. Failed reads do not synthesize an extra data stage.
- Unavailable sectors may be zero-filled with success by caller policy; this is
  not a promise of immutable storage or recovered audio.
- `log` is used for diagnostics. `usb-debug` adds control/command diagnostics and
  Embassy USB logging. The application supplies its logger and filter.
