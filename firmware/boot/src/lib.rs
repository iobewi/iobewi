//! Pure decision logic for a power-cut-safe transactional A/B boot chain:
//! the EWBT `otadata` entry format and the transitions a bootloader and
//! running application apply to it. No hardware access, no allocation -- it only says *what to write and
//! what to boot*, so every rule can be tested on the host, including a power
//! cut at every flash command, under an adversarial model of what a cut leaves
//! behind (see `tests`).
//!
//! # Entry format
//!
//! Two 4 KiB sectors, one 32-byte entry at the start of each, the same size and
//! position as ESP-IDF's `esp_ota_select_entry_t`, so the partition, the tooling
//! and the slot arithmetic stay. What differs is how an entry becomes *valid*.
//! ESP-IDF's CRC covers only `ota_seq`: a half-programmed state word can read as
//! another state (`New` = 0 as `Valid` = 2) behind a valid CRC, unless the flash
//! programs bytes strictly in address order -- a guarantee no flash datasheet
//! gives. Embewi entries therefore carry a **commit word**, programmed by a
//! separate flash command after the rest of the entry:
//!
//! ```text
//!  0  ota_seq         u32   } as ESP-IDF
//!  4  magic           "EWBT"   //!  8  format version  u32 = 1   | in ESP-IDF's `seq_label`, which it ignores
//! 12  ext_crc         u32       | crc32(seq, state, magic, version)
//! 16  reserved        u32 = erased
//! 20  commit word     u32 = COMMIT   <- programmed last, on its own
//! 24  ota_state       u32   } as ESP-IDF
//! 28  idf_crc         u32   } crc32(ota_seq), as ESP-IDF
//! ```
//!
//! An entry is accepted only if **every** field is exact. Anything else that is
//! not fully erased is *corrupt* and ignored -- including entries written the
//! ESP-IDF way, by design: no legacy mode. A cut before the commit word is
//! complete leaves an entry that is not accepted; a cut during it leaves either
//! that or the complete entry, whose body was already fully written. Nothing
//! depends on the order the flash programs cells *within* one command.
//!
//! # Rules
//!
//! * Only `Valid` is trusted. `New` is a candidate that has never run: booted
//!   at most once, after being marked `PendingVerify`.
//! * [`activate`] writes **one** entry (sequence and state together) into the
//!   sector that does not hold the last `Valid` entry, so the fallback image
//!   stays selectable through any interruption. `esp-bootloader-esp-idf`
//!   activates in two writes and picks the sector by raw sequence comparison
//!   (after a rollback it would erase the only good entry); the agent must use
//!   this crate instead.
//! * A blank `otadata` is a normal first boot, not an error: see [`plan_boot`].
