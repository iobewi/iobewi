/*
 * iobewi-esp-bootloader memory layout (ESP32-S3).
 *
 * Mirrors iobewi-esp-boot-esp32c3.x's approach exactly; only the addresses
 * change, because ESP32-S3's usable internal SRAM is larger. The ROM loads
 * the image found at flash offset 0 -- RAM segments only -- and jumps to its
 * entry point.
 *
 * SRAM is visible through two aliases: instruction bus 0x40370000.. and data
 * bus 0x3fc88000.., offset 0x6f0000 (esp-idf's `SOC_I_D_OFFSET` for
 * ESP32-S3 -- NOT the same constant as ESP32-C3's 0x700000). Code goes in
 * the IRAM alias, data and the stack in the DRAM alias, and the two regions
 * below are chosen so they do NOT cover the same physical bytes:
 *
 *   vectors_seg 0x403cb000..0x403cb400, IRAM 0x403cb400..0x403d4000
 *     <-> DRAM alias 0x3fcdb000..0x3fce4000
 *   DRAM 0x3fcf4000..0x3fcfc000  (data, bss, stack growing down from the end)
 *
 * Both windows sit inside the top of SRAM, below `boot_window`'s upper bound
 * (0x3fd00000, the top of ESP32-S3's DRAM range) -- that whole span is what
 * `iobewi_esp_platform::chips::esp32s3::BOOT_MEMORY_MAP.boot_window` reserves,
 * so it must stay consistent with this file if either one moves.
 *
 * The application image is loaded at the bottom of SRAM (0x40370000 /
 * 0x3fc88000 upwards); `main.rs` refuses any segment reaching this window.
