#![no_std]

//! One-shot ESP reboot adapter for the portable IOBEWI OTA reboot
//! capability (`iobewi_ota_http::RebootPort`).
//!
//! Owns exactly one thing: turning "schedule a reboot" into a real RTC
//! watchdog reset, deferred long enough for an in-flight HTTP response to
//! actually reach the socket. Knows nothing about OTA, HTTP routes,
//! provisioning, the agent, tokens, or lifecycle state -- those stay
//! entirely on the application side of `RebootPort`.

/// Gives the response time to actually reach the socket before resetting --
/// calling a reset directly from the request handler would cut the
/// connection before picoserve ever writes the confirmation page.
///
/// Uses the RTC watchdog (`ResetSystem`, the broadest of the three reset
/// scopes esp-hal exposes, `iobewi_esp_reset::arm_system_reset`) instead of
/// `iobewi_esp_reset::software_reset()`.
/// That function only does a "digital core" reset, which on this chip
/// leaves the native USB-Serial-JTAG peripheral's link state untouched: the
/// host still sees the old USB session, the freshly-booted firmware expects
/// a new one, and Improv Serial stops responding correctly until a real
/// (EN-pin/RTS-triggered) reset -- exactly what ESP Web Tools itself always
/// does when it resets the board, which is why that path never showed this.
